#!/usr/bin/env bash
# sign-pevm.sh — run one CGGMP21 `Pevm` threshold-signing session across the live devnet
# committee, over an arbitrary ABI-encoded preimage.
#
#   ./sign-pevm.sh <kind> <0x-preimage>
#
#     kind = mint    expects the 192-byte / 6-word mint tuple
#            rotate  expects the 160-byte / 5-word rotation tuple
#            raw     no length check (set FORCE_PREIMAGE=1 to mean the same thing)
#
# This is the generalised form of sign-mint.sh. The environment block, the signer-binary
# discovery, the per-node filter and the share glob are all copied from it verbatim —
# sign-mint.sh is the version that actually produced the H.2 mint signature, so it is the
# reference, not this file. Only three things differ here: the expected preimage shape,
# the log prefix (`<kind>-sign-*.log`, so a rotation run cannot clobber a mint run's logs,
# which 04-rotate.sh relies on), and a few extra guards on the way in and out.
#
# sign-mint.sh itself is deliberately left untouched so nothing that already works
# regresses. If you change the env surface in one, change it in both.
#
# WHY THE LENGTH CHECK MATTERS: the signer keccaks whatever bytes it is handed. Pass a
# 32-byte digest instead of the preimage and it will happily sign keccak(digest) — a
# perfectly valid signature over the wrong thing, which then fails as BadSigner on-chain
# with nothing pointing back to the real cause.
#
# Env:
#   SIGNER                             path to beldex-bridge-signer
#   BRIDGE_SIGNER_COMMITTEE_THRESHOLD  default 4 (devnet t+1)
#   BRIDGE_SIGNER_SIGN_TIMEOUT_SECS    default 600
#   SHARE_SUBDIR                       which per-node share tree to sign with
#                                      (default `shares`; `shares-next` = the
#                                      incoming committee, for the H.6 probe)
#   SHARE_GLOB                         override the per-node share discovery glob
#   LOG_PREFIX                         name the per-node logs <prefix>-sign-<node>.log
#                                      (default: the kind). Two runs of the SAME kind over
#                                      the same preimage with DIFFERENT share trees would
#                                      otherwise overwrite each other's logs — which is
#                                      exactly what the H.6 both-directions proof does.
#   FORCE_PREIMAGE=1                   skip the length check
#
# WHICH KEY SIGNS: the rotation signature must come from the key that is CURRENTLY
# in the contract, i.e. the default `shares`. SHARE_SUBDIR=shares-next is only for
# probing the INCOMING committee before you hand the bridge to it — signing the
# rotation with shares-next would be the new committee authorising itself, which
# proves nothing.
