#
# Every one of the eight steps in ROTATION_RUNBOOK.md already has a script. What did not
# exist until now is the ceremony: the thing that runs them in order, carries the 320- and
# 384-character preimages between the two repos without a human retyping them, and leaves
# one transcript behind. Both defects this project has hit in the rotation path so far —
# the `mv` onto a non-existent shares dir, and the zsh no-match glob — happened at those
# hand-run seams, not inside the bridge.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not decide anything. Every judgement call the runbook
# leaves to a human is still left to a human, behind a gate:
#
#     before step 1  the DKG        — 15 minutes of committee time, new key material
#     before step 5  the activation — an on-chain, irreversible hand-off of the bridge
#     before step 7  the promotion  — moves the live share trees on every node's disk
#
# Step 6b (the gateway handover) is NOT gated: it is the other half of the rotation, not a
# judgement call. A rotation that moves the mint authority without moving the release
# authority leaves the bridge issuing wBDX it cannot pay back.
#
# The gates ask for a literal "yes". Everything between them is checks and plumbing.
#
# WHAT IT ADDS over running the eight scripts by hand. Three assertions that no existing
# script makes, each of which turns a confusing downstream failure into a local one:
#
#   * the successor probe (step 2) must NOT recover to the address already in the contract.
#     If it does, the DKG produced the key that is already live and there is nothing to
#     rotate to — caught here, rather than as a "successor equals current signer" much later.
#   * the rotation signature (step 4) must recover to the OUTGOING key. sign-rotate.sh
#     honours SHARE_SUBDIR if it is set in your environment, and 04-rotate.sh checks the
#     digest but not the signer, so signing with shares-next by accident produces a
#     perfectly valid signature by the wrong key and fails as an opaque BadSigner on chain.
#   * the retired share tree (step 8) is discovered by DIFFING the shares-gen* directories
#     across the promotion, not by assuming it is shares-gen0. Assuming that is right
#     exactly once, on the first rotation.
#
# Env:
#   BRIDGE_DIR      the bridge-contract checkout      (default: ../../../bridge-contract)
#   RPC             the EVM node                      (default: http://127.0.0.1:8545)
#   KEYGEN          DKG generation number             (default: derived, see step 1)
#   HANDOFF_TXID    32-byte txid for the step-8 mint  (default: fresh random)
