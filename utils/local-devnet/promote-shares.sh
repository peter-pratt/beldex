# After the contract has activated the rotation, the bridge trusts the key that lives in
# devnet/shares-next. The signing scripts default to devnet/shares, so the trees have to be
# swapped or every subsequent sign-* run will sign with a key the contract no longer accepts.
#
# This exists as a script rather than a paste-into-your-terminal loop for two reasons:
#   * macOS defaults to zsh, where an unmatched glob is a hard error that aborts the command
#     (bash quietly passes the pattern through). A loop that is correct in one shell is broken
#     in the other. A file with a bash shebang has one, known shell.
#   * the swap is irreversible-ish and easy to half-do. Guards belong somewhere they can be
#     reviewed, not retyped.
#
# Env:
#   ARCHIVE   name for the retired tree (default: first free shares-gen<N>)
#   SUBDIR    the incoming tree (default shares-next)
