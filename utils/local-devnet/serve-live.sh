# active masternodes — 20 in a normal build (master_node_rules.h; the value is 5 only
# under BELDEX_ENABLE_INTEGRATION_TEST_HOOKS, i.e. -DBUILD_INTEGRATION=ON). This devnet
# runs 6, so it never checkpoints, the field is absent from every get_info, and the
# watcher's finality gate never opens: deposits confirm on chain, gateway_get_history is
# never called, and no mint duty is ever created — with no error in the serve log,
# because service.rs treats a poll error as transient. See DEVNET_FINALITY_BLOCKER.md.

# round are the session's canonical ACK set, passed per duty into pgw_sign/pevm_sign — the
# LiveSigners.signers field is never read again after this check. Listing the whole
