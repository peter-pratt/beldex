  // Recently published mint payloads, keyed by "beldex_txid:output_index" — one Beldex
  // transaction can pay several gateway outputs, and each is its own mint. Serves three
  // purposes:
  //  * de-duplication — the N committee members each produce the SAME payload for one
  //    deposit at about the same time; only the first fan-out within a short quiet period
  //    happens;
  //  * re-delivery — a publication of the same deposit AFTER that quiet period is fanned out
  //    again. Signers re-publish payloads the contract has not minted yet, and a relayer that
  //    missed or failed the first delivery depends on this to get another;
  //  * bounded RETENTION — a subscriber that connects (or reconnects after an outage) is
  //    replayed the retained backlog, so a relayer that was down does not permanently miss
  //    payloads published meanwhile. At-least-once by design: re-delivery is harmless
  //    because the wBDX contract's `processedDeposits` makes minting idempotent (a relayer
  //    detects the replay at gas estimation for the cost of an eth_call).
  // This is a bounded convenience buffer, NOT durable storage — the durable copy is each
  // signer's mint outbox, which re-publishes until the mint lands.
