//! # Beldex Sovereign Bridge threshold signer (Phase C scaffold)
//!
//! This crate is the off-chain service each **bridge-seated masternode** runs
//! alongside `beldexd`. It holds a *share* of each of the two committee keys and
//! cooperates with the other seated members to produce signatures — no member
//! ever holds either full key (security rule **S1**).
//!
//! Two keys, two chains, one committee (whitepaper §4.1):
//!   * `Pevm` — secp256k1, **CGGMP21** ([`LFDT-Lockness/cggmp21`]). Signs wBDX
//!     **mints** on EVM chains; the aggregate is a standard ECDSA signature that
//!     `ecrecover` verifies.
//!   * `Pgw`  — ed25519, **FROST** ([`ZcashFoundation/frost`]). Owns the Beldex
//!     L1 gateway and signs **releases**; the aggregate is an ordinary ed25519
//!     signature verified by consensus via libsodium `crypto_sign_verify_detached`.
//!
//! The consensus source of truth is `beldexd`: the committee membership, epoch,
//! and threshold come from the on-chain `bridge` quorum (Phase B), read via the
//! `bridge.committee` OxenMQ endpoint — the signer never recomputes consensus.
//!
//! ## What is in this scaffold
//!
//! This is the C.1 stage: the service skeleton plus the *self-contained,
//! security-critical logic that can be implemented and tested without the TSS
//! crates*:
//!   * [`config`]       — service configuration + validation.
//!   * [`committee`]    — the epoch/committee view mirrored from `beldexd`.
//!   * [`conformance`]  — **S10** canonical-signature helpers: secp256k1 low-S
//!                        normalisation (so `Pevm` output round-trips `ecrecover`)
//!                        and ed25519 canonical-S checks (for `Pgw`).
//!   * [`pool`]         — **S3** bounded, single-use preprocessed-material pool
//!                        (CGGMP21 presignature tuples / FROST nonce pairs):
//!                        consume-and-erase, erase-on-refresh, hard cap `L ≤ 128`.
//!   * [`session`]      — **C.4** the signing-session state machine (Consensus →
//!                        Sign → Distribute → Finalize) with a deterministic
//!                        leader, timeout/retry with fault exclusion, transcript
//!                        accumulation (S4), and per-leg session ids (S14).
//!   * [`dkg`]          — **C.2** dual distributed-key-generation orchestration:
//!                        the round-progress state machine, DKG payload codec, and
//!                        share-store hand-off for both legs (disjoint flows, S14).
//!                        The audited crates run the rounds (S12).
//!   * [`wire`]         — **C.4** session-message codec + dispatch that carries
//!                        engine events between signers over a [`transport`], with
//!                        S14 enforcement and async-mesh-tolerant drop semantics.
//!   * [`wire_auth`]    — **S4** per-message ed25519 authentication that binds a
//!                        `WireMsg`'s self-declared `from` to the sender's on-chain
//!                        transport key, so the transcript is unforgeable and
//!                        attributable (feeds Phase F slashing evidence).
//!   * [`share_store`]  — the **D.1** share-custody interface (non-exportable
//!                        use, versioned backups, epoch-consistent erasure).
//!   * [`transport`]    — the session transport abstraction (real backend: a thin
//!                        OxenMQ binding — see the plan §2.3 transport note).
//!   * [`health`]       — the bridge-signer liveness/heartbeat status surfaced to
//!                        `beldexd`'s `uptime_proof` (Phase B.8).
//!   * [`chain_registry`] — **E.3** per-chain config `{contract, confirmations,
//!                        per-epoch cap, per-tx max}` + fixed-window cap accounting.
//!   * [`watch`]        — **Phase E** watcher core: normalized [`watch::MintEvent`]/
//!                        [`watch::ReleaseEvent`] with canonical digests, reorg-safe
//!                        finality (S9), and per-member proposal agreement (E.4 → S4).
//!
//! The DKG, presigning and signing rounds themselves (C.2–C.5) integrate the
//! audited crates and are **not** reimplemented here (**S12**); they slot onto
//! these primitives once the `DUE_DILIGENCE.md` C.1 gate is closed.
