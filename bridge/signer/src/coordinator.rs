//! Autonomy **session coordination** (design: `bridge/docs/AUTONOMY_SESSION_COORDINATION.md`).
//!
//! The layer between the duty [`Orchestrator`](crate::orchestrator::Orchestrator) (which knows
//! *what* work exists) and the tested [`Session`](crate::session::Session) engine (which knows
//! how a committee agrees + signs a *known* payload). It closes the autonomy gap: with no
//! operator and no shared clock, every honest node must independently converge on the same
//! session, the same leader, and the same message for each observed duty.
//!
//! The load-bearing idea (§3 of the design): **decouple the coordination key from the signing
//! message.**
//!
//! * [`session_key`] — a 32-byte digest of the *duty* (`leg ‖ epoch ‖ kind ‖ on-chain id`),
//!   computable by every node the moment it observes the finalized event. It seeds
//!   `SessionId.payload_hash`, and therefore the deterministic leader — so leadership needs no
//!   election messages at all.
//! * The signing message is carried by the leader's `Propose` and admitted by each member's
//!   own [`ProposalPolicy::verify`] (the C.5 rule — never sign a leader blob you did not
//!   independently justify). For a mint the verifier is byte-equality against the member's own
//!   rebuilt preimage; for a release it is the R1–R6 semantic predicate (task #2).
//!
//! Everything here is std-only and driven through the [`SessionTransport`] trait, so the whole
//! multi-node flow is testable on an in-process bus; the curve-authenticated OMQ mesh slots in
//! unchanged (S4 authentication happens *below* this layer, in `wire_auth`/`omq_mesh`).
