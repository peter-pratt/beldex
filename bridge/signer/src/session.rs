//! The signing-session engine (plan §7 C.4), modelled on Pulse (`pos.cpp`).
//!
//! A session drives one signing request through four time-bounded, auto-retrying
//! stages:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Consensus ──▶ Sign ──▶ Distribute ──▶ Finalize
//!      │  ▲ (timeout / NACK-storm: bump attempt, fresh leader, exclude faulty)
//!      └──┘
//! ```
//!
//! * **Consensus** — a *deterministic leader* proposes the exact payload to sign;
//!   `>= t+1` members ACK (or NACK a bad proposal). This stage is **security-
//!   critical, not liveness plumbing (S4)**: the agreed payload + participant set
//!   is the transcript root every later message and every slashing report binds
//!   to. Each member independently rebuilds and checks the payload before ACKing
//!   (never signs a leader-supplied blob blind — the C.5 rule).
//! * **Sign** — the scheme rounds run (CGGMP21 for a mint, FROST for a release).
//!   This engine dispatches on [`Leg`] but does **not** do the crypto (S12): it
//!   collects round contributions and hands off to the vendored crates.
//! * **Distribute** — the combined signature is broadcast to all members.
//! * **Finalize** — hand off to a relayer and **every member persists the
//!   transcript**.
//!
//! Liveness: a stage timeout (or a NACK that drops the honest set below `t+1`)
//! bumps the attempt counter, which deterministically selects a **fresh leader**
//! and **excludes** the faulty member, then restarts at Consensus with an honest
//! `>= t+1` subset. Safety: **session IDs and transcripts are namespaced per key
//! (S14)** — a `Pevm` session object is never accepted into a `Pgw` session.
//!
//! The engine is a pure, deterministic state machine so it is fully unit-testable
//! without a live mesh; the real transport (OxenMQ) and the real TSS rounds slot
//! in around it.
