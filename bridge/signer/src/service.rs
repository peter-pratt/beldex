//! The autonomy **service** — the outer loop and its backends, sitting on the tested
//! [`crate::orchestrator`] control flow.
//!
//! * [`DutyBackend`] is where the networked, leg-specific work lives (run the mesh signing
//!   session and submit). A blanket impl turns any `DutyBackend` into a
//!   [`crate::orchestrator::DutyExecutor`], so the [`serve`] loop only sees the tested seam.
//! * [`serve`] runs `tick` on a timer with graceful shutdown.
//! * [`WatcherEventSource`] (feature-gated) is the concrete [`crate::orchestrator::EventSource`]
//!   over the real watchers — deposits → mints, burns → releases.
//!
//! **Submission asymmetry (deliberate).** A **mint** is signed on the `Pevm` leg and the signed
//! [`crate::watch::MintEvent`] payload is **emitted for a keyless relayer** to broadcast — the
//! signer never holds an EVM gas key (Phase I; relayers are not a trust component). A
//! **release** is signed on the `Pgw` leg and self-submitted via the daemon's
//! `gateway_submit_transfer` RPC (an L1 tx, no external gas). So `handle_mint` ends at "signed +
//! handed off"; the on-chain replay guard (`processedDeposits`) is the ultimate dedup backstop.
